# Reinforcement Learning examples with OpenAI Gym

Using the OpenAI API develop solutions for the Ping-Pong game and the Space Invaders.
The aproach used to get the info for the NN to make the desicion is the difference between 2 frames.
The training was performed for 1500.

In the Space invaders game we notice that the agent doen't perform so well, thats it because
the reward isn't as "obvious" as a the Pong game, because the bullet takes several frames to
hit something. Thus Invaders is a more complex enviroment.
